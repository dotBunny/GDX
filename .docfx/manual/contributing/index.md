# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to GDX! :heart:

> While the `GDX` package has Unity employees amongst its contributors, it is **not officially supported by Unity**, and it is not on Unity's roadmap.

## [Boostrap](/manual/contributing/bootstrap.html)

A secondary repository which allows for streamlined development of `GDX` outside of existing projects. This is used by automation as well to validate every commit.

## [Automation](/manual/contributing/automation.html)

An overview of the automation that is ran in TeamCity against all commits to `GDX`.

## [Coding Standard](/manual/contributing/coding-standard.html)

We try and keep some semblance of order to the `GDX` codebase. Building on the shoulders of the .NET team.

## [Assisting with Documentation](/manual/contributing/documentation.html)

We aim to put documentation first. If a developer fails to grasp why to utilize a feature or component in `GDX`, we have not done our job effectively. Creating good documentation is important; please help us!
