# Contributing
 
Thank you for your interest in contributing to GDX! :heart:

## [Code of Conduct](/manual/contributing/code-of-conduct.html)
GitHub generated a nice and concise code of conduct agreement for the project. Let us be very explicit: **don't be an asshole**. Good and bad days happen, but the goal is to move forward together.

## [Design Guidelines](/manual/contributing/design-guidelines.html) 
We try and keep some semblance of order to the `GDX` codebase. Building on the shoulders of the .NET team.

## [Assisting with Documentation](/manual/contributing/documentation.html)
We aim to put documentation first. If a developer fails to grasp why to utilize a feature or component in `GDX`, we have not done our job effectively. Creating good documentation is important; please help us!
