# Requirements
The package is designed to be compatible with an _empty project_ created in [Unity](http://unity3d.com).
It uses a preprocessor system, where the assembly definition will define features based on the packages found in the project.
> It is important to note that the GDX_* defines are only valid inside of the GDX assemblies.
